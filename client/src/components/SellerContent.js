                <h3>Services</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        A service is anything that is not a real object can be a doctor, lawyer, dentist, agent, plumber, etc.
                        <ul>
                            <li>Typically charged by the hour or a part of their business (see example: an electrician can come and inspect the wiring for your home and recommend or offer their first hour at the cost of the auction.)</li>
                            <li>We ask this is done via zip code for local service industry work, of course unless the company is franchised or national.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        When a service is placed in the storybook a video as well as the description is to be as close to possible as what the auction is about. (example: ABC plumbers will come and inspect your valve and pipes for $reserve our normal rate is $$$.)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        We recommend a reserve rate is added to the description. Although it will be in story mode for 6 hrs before going live so one could always start at $1 and go off pre-bids.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        All services must be met upon payment made, we recommend that a link is gone onto either an email or website explaining all that your service is and what the customer just bought so they can set up a meeting or appointment.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Please keep in mind that all services are helping your business and building it so good customer service is always a plus. We ask for feedback.
                    </li>
